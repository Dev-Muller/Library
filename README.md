Library Management System
Welcome to the Library Management System project! This project was developed as part of a challenge in the Java track of Ignite. The goal is to apply fundamental Java concepts, including inheritance, polymorphism, loop structures, and date manipulation.

## Features

### Book Management

- **List all available books**: Displays only the books that are available for loan.
- **Perform a book loan**: Allows a user to choose an available book and register the loan.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following main classes:

- **Book**: Represents the books in the library, with attributes like `id`, `title`, `author`, `available`, `registrationDate`, and `updateDate`.
- **Author**: Represents the authors of the books, with attributes like `id`, `name`, and `birthDate`.
- **Loan**: Manages the book loans, with information about the borrowed book and loan and return dates.
- **Library**: Manages the collection of books, authors, and loans.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- IDE of your choice (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans, etc.)

## Getting Started

The application will ask if you want to view the available books. After choosing a book, you can proceed with the loan, which will be registered and the book marked as unavailable.
